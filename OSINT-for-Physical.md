## 1.  Facility Reconnaissance (Physical & Perimeter)

###  Building Addresses & Locations
- Google Maps (Street View, Satellite, Earth 3D)
- Bing Maps (Bird’s Eye)
- OpenStreetMap
- LinkedIn (for building names and architect portfolios)
  - _e.g._ `site:linkedin.com "123 Main Street" Design OR Architect

###  Access Points & Security Features

- External staircases

###  Business Directory & Listings
- Google My Business
- Yelp / TripAdvisor (interior photos)
- LoopNet / CoStar
- Use tax records to ID building owner
- Search Internet Archive for older listings

###  Proximity Risks & Enablers
- Nearby police stations, government offices, politicians

## 2.  Employee & Organizational Intelligence

###  Employee Name Harvesting
- LinkedIn (Company + “People”)
- ZoomInfo / RocketReach / SignalHire
  - When signing up for an account, do **not** give these websites access to your email and don't use their plugins. That is how they scrape/collect data. 
- Staff bios on the company site

###  Email Patterns
- Hunter.io
- OSINT Email Lookup Tools
- Google Dork: `@company.com site:linkedin.com`

###  Contact Info
- TruePeopleSearch / WhoCalledMe / TrueCaller (US)
- FOIA requests (public sector)
- Company press releases

###  Hiring & Job Posts
- LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, ZipRecruiter
- Look for references to badge access, policies, vendors

###  Vendors & 3rd Parties
- Cleaning, maintenance companies (Yelp, job postings)
- IT vendors (non-@company emails)

### Ad and Technical Intel
- [Facebook and Instagram Ad Library](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library)

## 3.  Badge & Uniform Recon

###  Badge Photos
- LinkedIn profile pics, social media
- Conference slides and press kits

###  Uniform & Dress Code
- Website staff photos
- Job listings for “company-issued uniforms”

###  Courier & Vendor Pretexts

## 4.  Social Engineering Attack Surface

###  Employee Habits & Check-ins
- Instagram, Facebook location tags
- Twitter/X searches like “Working at [Company]”
- [Strava Global Heatmap](https://www.strava.com/maps/global-heatmap?sport=All&style=dark&terrain=false&labels=true&poi=true&cPhotos=true&gColor=blue&gOpacity=100#16.47/43.932252/-102.159401), Fitbit, MapMyRun
   - *This is useful for more rural sites. You can find common running or biking routes near a facility. You can learn nearby traffic patters and hotspots for exercise, which could enable loitering and opportunities for surveillance. This can also show where people park, where there are fences (if there's a line the paths don't cross), and you may even find guard patrol routes along the perimeter.* 

###  Company Lingo & Internal Culture
- LinkedIn posts, Glassdoor reviews
- Industry Slack/Discord chatter

###  Events & Conferences
- EventBrite, Meetup RSVPs
- Company blog & speaker announcements
- Industry summits and attendee lists

###  IT & Help Desk Clues

- Help Desk/SOC job postings (look for MFA, reset workflows)

###  Executive & VIP Profiles
- Google Dork: `"CEO name" filetype:pdf`
- People search tools: Pipl, FamilyTreeNow
- FOIA filings (public sector execs)
- Public company 10-Ks (investor sites)
- Executive interviews (home or office reveals)

  - *Use the free sites to find data of interest, then google the bill of landing or other unique numbers that you want more information about. The free sites tend to provide limited information, but you can find additional details by searching for specific import/export records once you identify what you're interested in.*
