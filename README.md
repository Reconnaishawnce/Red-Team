### Who does Physical Security Red Teaming?

Technology companies, banks, government agencies, energy companies, consultants, and many companies that protect critical assets, work in high-risk environments, or simply want to have industry leading security all conduct physec red teaming. 

### Why conduct Red Teaming?

If you have high-value assets, serious threats to your organization, or have discovered significant vulnerabilities the hard way - red teaming is for you. Red teaming should enable the business to carry out its mission with greater confidence, less surprises, and no interruptions.. A good red team assessment will provide the business with key information relating to:
+ **Tactics:** The most likely tactics a threat actor (bad person/group) will use against your organization. This makes it *much* easier to focus resources and defend against those tactics. 
+ **Undiscovered Vulnerabilities:** Uncover major undiscovered vulnerabilities. Red teams will often say "better us than them" - meaning it's better that an internal team uncover an organization's weaknesses than someone with bad intentions. 
+ **Address our Hubris:** As security and risk management professionals, we think we know how to best protect our business, people, assets, and reputation. With stakes this high, we must be willing to test ourselves against real-world situations to see if our security measures hold up. Professional sports teams never go from practice straight to head-to-head games with their opponents. They have scrimmage, drills, pre-season, and other low-risk tests of their effectiveness. Likewise, a red team is your scrimmage partner. 
+ **Better Budgeting:** Red teams challenge security assumptions and determine whether the money you spend on security, compliance, and risk management are truly keeping your business safer. There are many ways to allocate budget that we assume result in risk reduction. A red team determines whether these measures truly reduce risk, giving you confidence and providing the data to be most efficient with our 
+ **Protect your Assets:** Protect your most important assets. Efficient red teams target your company's most important assets. Outside of being targeted by real-world adversaries, there is no better way to understand how well you are protecting your assets than a red team conducting an assessment on your most company assets. These assets can be anything from employees, knowledge, intellectual property, servers, crypto assets, passwords, company bank accounts, financial assets, equipment, and much more.  
+ **Protect your Business:** An assumption built on an assumption which is built on another assumptions is a house of cards ready to collapse when one foundational assumption turns out to be false. Red teams are assumption assassins. They systematically identify corporate, security, and risk management assumptions and test to see if they are true (therefor, no longer assumptions), or false - in which case leadership then has the clarity and information they need to make more informed decisions. All of this enables the business to operate uninterrupted, minimizing surprises, and strengthening both resilience and confidence.   

### Physical Security Red Teaming

Companies will often have cybersecurity red team, occasionally hardware red teams and AI red teams - but only a select few organizations employ internal physical security red teams. These organizations protect some of the world's most valuable assets, and have a very low appetite for loss. Technology companies such as Google and Facebook (Meta) have posted jobs indicating they have full internal red teams, while financial institutions such as UBS, Bank of America, Capitol One, and other large banks that hold a significant portion of the world's financial assets have teams of various types to test their security. As adversaries are running into increasing roadblacks and digital security, many are looking to physical attacks to gain information or access to internal networks. 
<br>
The global Physical Security market in 2022 was estimated to exceed $127 billion, with an expected increase up to $215 billion by 2030. How do we know that these billions are keeping businesses and populations safer? With real-world incidents and red team assessments. Waiting for a real incident to occur can have costly and sometimes catastrophic consequences. On the other hand, a red team assessment comes as close to a real-world incident without introducing the risk to people, assets, and businesses that come with an adversary's attack. In an environment where adversaries have to be right once to succeed, and businesses have to get it right 100% of time - physical security red teams work to ensure that your business succeeds and your adversaries fail. 

### Physical Security Red Teaming Resources

To date, there is no extensive, free, or open source information repository to support businesses who want to:
+ Build an internal red team (there are many times - see *Types of Red Teams*)
+ Hire external consultants to test their security measures
+ Improve their physical red team
+ Expand their red team scope to include physical assessments
+ Enable security teams to test themselves

Over the past two decades, I have built the first internal red team at a FAANG company, consulted with many business who are building red teams, conducted red team assessments across the globe, taught (and continue to teach) red teaming to graduate students, helped law enforcement incorporate red teaming ideologies into training, and collaborated with hundreds of red teams from government entities, multinational corporations, and consultancies. There are ample and ever-expanding resources and cybersecurity red teams, but severely limited resources available for physical security red teams. The objective of this page is to provide and share resources, leading practices, strategies, frameworks, and knowledge with the physical security red teaming community.

### In-House or Outsourced Red Teams

In this post we discuss:
1) Definitions on different types of red team assessments
2) Two common approaches to red teaming seen at large corporations and government entities (in-house and outsourced) 
3) Eight additional models that have been successful and combine in-house and outsourced in a way that makes the best use of security budget, team talent, and vendor expertise. 
4) Description on how to use these models as a team manager both to help individuals grow in their role, and help the team grow in their performance and capabilities.
5) A list of factors to consider when selecting the right model that works for your team or organization.  

**Definitions:**
> + **Engagement:** A red team operation is often referred to as an engagement. It encompases the planning, execution, and reporting phase of a red team assessment. 
> + **Low Level Test / Assurance Test:** Low level, small scale, or assurance tests focus on a specific control (security measure) or controls, and are limited in scope. While a full scale engagement may involve using many different ways to steal a specific piece of information, an assurance test is more likely to test a specific control, such as an access control point (door, turnstile, security officer). Assurance tests are great opportunities to partner with other security teams, where you can provide real-world testing against recent training that security personnel completed, or test new security equipment before it is rolled out broadly. By definition, it is not a true red team assessment, but more of a targeted assessment to determine the performance of specific security measures. 
> + **Full Scale Engagement:** A holistic and realistic assessment of security measures by a red team, emulating adversarial tactics to meet the adversary’s objective. In plain english, the red team pretends to be a company’s enemy (typically a hostile country or competitor) to steal valuable information or items. True adversaries have little constraints in their approach to targeting your company, and a full scale red team engagement should reflect this fact. A full scale engagement should have as few constraints as possible, the team should be creative in their approach, and truly behave like an adversary would behave as they target your assets. If the team is to live up to a good red team motto (“Better us than them”) then it’s incumbent upon the red team to reflect the tactics, capabilities, and motivations of the adversary to provide the most accurate picture of when, where, why, and how the company will be attacked. 

Corporates with different needs, budgets, headcounts, internal skill sets, and constraints must decide on a red teaming approach that reflects their reality. Many organizations will take an overly-simplistic view and consider only two options: outsourced, or in-house. 
+ **Outsourced:** Hiring consultants to conduct red team assessments and report findings to you. The red teamer is employed by a company who was contracted to test security. 
+ **In House:** Hiring employees or reallocated employee time to conduct red teaming. The red teamer is employed by the organization they are assessing. 

In reality, there are often better models that adopt a hybrid approach to maximize benefits from both outsourced and in-house. These may include:
+ **Hybrid Operator:** There are less operators in-house, and they embed within larger consultant teams on engagements. 
+ **Learning Model:** The assessment or team is fully led by outside subject matter expert consultants, with one or two in-house members joining as trainees or operators. The in-house personnel can learn from the experts in real time as they conduct the assessment. In this case, the organization obtains hands-on real-world training and a red team assessment for the price of a red team assessment. This is a great way to build operator confidence, create new leaders, and help non-red teamers begin to transition to red teaming roles. 
+ **Hybrid Mitigation:** In-house red teamers focus on translating findings (i.e. vulnerabilities) into mitigatory actions (patching vulnerabilities). They may embed on operations but this is more so to understand security posture and exploits so they can help fix it, than it is to add skills or knowledge to the team. 
+ **Outsourced Assurance Model:** In-house operators conduct full-scale engagements, while outsourced red team personnel conduct more frequent low-level assessments. This is good when A) you do not trust your outsourced consultants to conduct full scale assessments against your enterprise or; B) when your assets are too valuable to have an outside organization or personnel knowledgeable of security measures surrounding that (or - when your leadership believes this to be the case). 
+ **Assurance Model:** Your in-house team focuses on low-level assurance assessments, while your outsourced team conducts full-scale operations. 
+ **Outsourced Leadership:** When a consultant with extensive red team experience leads your internal team during an engagement. 
+ **Outsourced Operator Model:** When you manage and control the assessment with in-house leadership, but a portion of the team is comprised of outsourced consultants or personnel. This may be particularly relevant when looking for a specific skill set that you would like to test, but that talent is not available in-house. 
+ **Academic Model:** There are several academic security programs in the United States that have major red team components. As part of these programs, both students and instructors hunger for real-world experience and applications of the topics discussed in a classroom. Partnering with an academic program to get low/no cost red team assessments can provide both financial and talent-pipeline costs to your organization.

***Discouraged Models***
> **Part Time:** If you are unable to obtain both external consultants and an in-house red team, a part-time red team can still provide a significant benefit to the organization. This requires security and security-aligned professionals to dedicate a specific percent of their time to coming together and conducting a red team assessment against the very assets they spend much of their time protecting. There are significant pros and cons to this approach, both of which will be discussed in a future post. <br />
> **Contingent Worker (CW):** Many companies will use contractors or contingent workers to staff their security teams. While this may be a less expensive option for the company, you are likely to have trust, loyalty, and capability options. For an important, specialized team identifying the company’s most significant vulnerabilities, you should have either a walled-off third party, or a fully in-house team doing the work. 

Good people managers make clear paths for their team members to grow and flourish as individuals and employees. Good team managers enable employees to grow in their roles and enable the team to develop strategically and cohesively as a unit. I have watched one of the best red team managers I have worked with develop a program that creates a clear path for growth based on the above models. She built it as such: 
1) As a new junior operator, members of the team must participate in two learning model assessments. Junior operators need-not have physical red team experience - the manager instead selected creative contrarians who espoused the drive, perspective, and mindset that would enable them to be an effective team member. 
2) As junior members graduated to operators (standard members of the team), they would then be tasked with:
    > + Overseeing three vendor-driven assurance tests;
    > + Being an operator in one hybrid or in-house full scale assessment; and
    > + Leading two full scale assessments. These were often hybrid assessments with vendors providing personnel to augment team capabilities. Good vendors may even be willing to have their experts and leaders join in on an assessment in non-leadership roles to help your in-house team develop new effective leadership. 
3) At this point - typically one-and-a-half to two years after starting on the red team - the member is now designated as a Senior Red Team Operator. The ability to grow in a role and as a team provides a significant morale boost, leading to better individual and team performance. 


There are a number of factors that should help you decide which model to take when establishing a corporate red team, or when deciding on how to approach a specific engagement: 
+ **Trust (Existing):** How much do you trust your red team vendors? 
+ **Trust (Needed):** How much trust is needed for a specific red team assessment? Do you have exceptionally valuable assets that outsiders can not see? 
+ **Vendor Talent:** Do you have vendors that have the skills to conduct the assessment you need (i.e. are the vendors capable)? Conversely, do you have vendors with specific skill sets needed to test a specific control? 
+ **In-House Talent:** Do you have the skills, numbers, and experience in-house to conduct the assessment(s) that are needed for your organization? 
+ **Cost:** What does it cost to outsource the red team assessment, and what does it cost to bring them in house? What additional benefits do you get for each scenario? 
+ **Bureaucracy:** Does your company have an exceptionally high bar for onboarding new vendors? Is the headcount approval and hiring process so lengthy and painful that your time and money would be better spent working with vendors? Consider the pros and cons of each option based on the strengths and weaknesses of your corporate bureaucracy. 
+ **Existing Resources:** Do you have existing vendors that are capable of conducting red team assessments? What about existing personnel or teams that could be repurposed part or full time for this role?
